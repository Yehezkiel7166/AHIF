# AHIF — Artificial Human Identity Framework

**Version:** 2.0.0-rc1
**Status:** Machine-Readable Knowledge Expansion — Release Candidate
**Primary use case:** Consistent AI travel influencer generation from one canonical master photo.

AHIF is a modular software-engineering framework for generating a persistent digital human whose identity remains stable while clothing, hairstyle, pose, expression, activity, camera, weather response, and storytelling adapt to the requested context.

## Core operating principle

> Identity First. Human Second. Reality Third. Beauty Fourth.

## Framework pipeline

```text
Knowledge Graph
→ Decision Engine
→ Reasoning Engine
→ Prompt Compiler
→ Quality Assurance
→ Final Prompt
→ Model Adapter
```

Version 2.0.0-rc1 adds a validated machine-readable knowledge layer to the existing identity-first pipeline. Canonical Markdown remains authoritative while structured packages provide stable identifiers, provenance, deterministic validation, and adapter-consumable metadata.

## Daily use

1. Upload the canonical master photo to the image generator.
2. Upload `00_CONTEXT/AHIF_AI_CONTEXT.md` to ChatGPT.
3. Ask ChatGPT to load the framework.
4. Provide a compact request:

```text
Location: Kyoto, Japan
Place: Gion district
Atmosphere: calm autumn morning
Output: final image-generation prompt
```

5. AHIF normalizes context, resolves decisions, validates reasoning, compiles one coherent prompt, runs mandatory QA gates, and releases only a validated artifact.

## Architectural responsibilities

- **Knowledge Graph** represents reusable facts and relationships.
- **Decision Engine** selects context-appropriate visual decisions.
- **Reasoning Engine** validates causality, evidence, alternatives, confidence, identity safety, and cross-domain coherence.
- **Prompt Compiler** expresses accepted decisions in deterministic model-neutral prompt form without inventing new decisions.
- **Quality Assurance** applies mandatory gates, deterministic linting, failure classification, scoring, and recovery routing.
- **Final Prompt Engine** orchestrates the complete execution, enforces release eligibility, and emits the validated prompt package and explainable result summary.
- **Model Adapter Layer** translates a released package into an exact target request while preserving identity, semantics, provenance, and loss disclosure.

## Source of truth

The repository is the source of truth. AI context files are condensed operational views derived from canonical modules.

## Canonical identity rule

The uploaded master photo is the only canonical identity reference. Text may clarify the image but must never replace, reinterpret, or override it.

## Current release — 2.0.0-rc1

Sprint 010 introduces the first release-candidate machine-readable knowledge layer. It adds stable knowledge identifiers, provenance policy, package and registry schemas, a central registry, candidate fashion/travel/photography packages, knowledge QA, and regression tests. Structured packages remain subordinate to canonical Markdown and are not promoted to stable `active` status until the 2.0 release gate.

The permanent architectural rules are defined in [`PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md`](PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md).
